### 🎯 The Problem

NUS currently lacks a unified platform for students to easily gather information and effectively utilize it for their academic and non-academic planning. This fragmentation can lead to missed opportunities, scheduling conflicts, and difficulty in accessing shared resources.

### ✨ Our Solution: NUSphere

NUSphere aims to be the **glue** that links everything together for NUS students. It's designed as a collaborative workspace to help students work together, making their academic life more eventful, organized, and well-planned.
